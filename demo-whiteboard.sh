echo "üéØ HAiPAD Whiteboard Dashboard Implementation Demo"
echo "================================================="
echo ""

echo "üì± New Features Implemented:"
echo ""

echo "1. üé® WHITEBOARD GRID LAYOUT:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ iPad: 4 columns √ó 6 rows (24 total positions)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ iPhone: 2 columns √ó 8 rows (16 total positions)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ 12pt spacing between cards"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ 16pt margins around the grid"
echo ""

echo "2. üéØ FREE CARD POSITIONING:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Entity cards can be placed in any grid position"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Positions are automatically saved and restored"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Similar to iOS 18 widget placement on home screen"
echo ""

echo "3. üñ±Ô∏è DRAG & DROP INTERACTION:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Long press any card for 0.5 seconds"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Card scales to 110% and becomes 80% transparent"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Drag to any valid grid position"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Visual feedback during drag operation"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Drop to confirm new position"
echo ""

echo "4. ‚ûï EMPTY SLOT VISUALIZATION:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Dashed border rectangles show available positions"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Subtle '+' icon indicates drop zones"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Highlighted feedback when dragging over slots"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Clear distinction between occupied and free spaces"
echo ""

echo "5. üíæ PERSISTENT STORAGE:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Positions saved in NSUserDefaults automatically"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Key format: 'ha_entity_positions'"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Value format: entity_id -> grid position string"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Survives app restarts and device reboots"
echo ""

echo "üìã USAGE EXAMPLE:"
echo ""
echo "# Typical user workflow:"
echo "1. Open HAiPAD dashboard"
echo "2. See entities in automatic grid positions"
echo "3. See empty slots marked with dashed borders and '+' icons"
echo "4. Long press on 'Living Room Light' card"
echo "5. Card becomes highlighted and slightly larger"
echo "6. Drag to desired position (e.g., top-right corner)"
echo "7. Drop in empty slot - position saved automatically"
echo "8. Restart app - 'Living Room Light' stays in chosen position"
echo ""

echo "üõ†Ô∏è  TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:"
echo ""
echo "‚Ä¢ WhiteboardGridLayout: Custom UICollectionViewLayout"
echo "‚Ä¢ EmptyGridSlotView: Visual indicators for drop zones"
echo "‚Ä¢ Enhanced DashboardViewController: Drag/drop handling"
echo "‚Ä¢ Grid position calculation and validation"
echo "‚Ä¢ iOS 9.3.5 compatible throughout"
echo ""

echo "üé® VISUAL DESIGN:"
echo ""
echo "‚Ä¢ Empty slots: Subtle blue dashed borders"
echo "‚Ä¢ Drop feedback: Highlighted blue background"
echo "‚Ä¢ Drag state: Scaled card with transparency"
echo "‚Ä¢ Grid spacing: Consistent with original card design"
echo "‚Ä¢ Visual hierarchy: Empty slots behind entity cards"
echo ""

echo "üß™ TO TEST:"
echo ""
echo "1. Add the new source files to Xcode project:"
echo "   - WhiteboardGridLayout.h/m"
echo "   - EmptyGridSlotView.h/m"
echo ""
echo "2. Build and run on iOS Simulator or device"
echo ""
echo "3. Test drag and drop:"
echo "   - Long press any entity card"
echo "   - Drag to different grid positions"
echo "   - Verify positions persist after restart"
echo ""
echo "4. Verify empty slot visualization:"
echo "   - See dashed borders for available positions"
echo "   - Check '+' icons in empty slots"
echo "   - Confirm highlighting during drag operations"
echo ""

echo "üìä COMPARISON:"
echo ""
echo "BEFORE (Auto-flow Layout):"
echo "‚Ä¢ Cards arranged automatically in reading order"
echo "‚Ä¢ No user control over positioning"
echo "‚Ä¢ Fixed 2-column grid (iPad) / 1-column (iPhone)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Standard UICollectionViewFlowLayout"
echo ""
echo "AFTER (Whiteboard Layout):"
echo "‚Ä¢ User-controlled card positioning"
echo "‚Ä¢ Visual grid with empty slot indicators"
echo "‚Ä¢ Persistent custom layouts"
echo "‚Ä¢ iOS 18 widget-style interaction"
echo "‚Ä¢ 4-column grid (iPad) / 2-column (iPhone)"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!"
echo ""
echo "The whiteboard dashboard transforms HAiPAD from a simple"
echo "list-based interface into a customizable, widget-style"
echo "dashboard where users can arrange their Home Assistant"
echo "entities exactly where they want them, just like iOS 18"
echo "widgets on the home screen."
